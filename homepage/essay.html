            <h1>His Portable India</h1>
            <p> Despite specifically typing New York into the Google search engine, the internet will still display thousands of images of towering skyscrapers, sleek streets of Fifth Avenue lined with luxury boutiques, iconic yellow taxis zooming through bustling streets, and kaleidoscopes like lights in Times Square. Often forgetting that New York is a state and doesn’t just consist of one borough, but more importantly, forgetting that it’s all a mirage. Anyone who has ever resided in this city will tell you that all these features are probably the reason why people come for opportunities and not a future. The city we know isn’t the one that you post on Instagram with the caption “#getaway”. The city we do know has articles on increased crime rates, enterprises that once dominated the market now filing for bankruptcy, and streets that will forever remain filthy. None of this is more apparent than between first ave and ave A, the Punjabi Grocery and Deli.

            <p> Behind every man in a lavish suit and tie was an immigrant who would watch from afar and come home every night wondering if what they were doing was enough for their family. Was the twelve hours of long driving in a yellow cab worth the risk of coming to America? Would they ever find their place in a foreign world? My father was no exception to these concerns, and almost as if it were a fever dream, he found a cure in the shabby alleyways of 2nd Ave. Bhārata dā pratīka, or the epitome of India, is what my father’s generation happened to call the shop, and rightfully so. Just like his village back in India, the shop embodied all the characteristics of a traditional Punjabi family. Everything from the pungent garam masala being added to the chai to the old men bickering about the annual cricket tournaments felt like home. The religious hymns “Arti” and “Wahenguru” drowned in their laughter, only being heard when they would occasionally take a moment to catch their breath. In a city so diverse and full of color, my father had found his portable India, and he made sure I did too.

            <p> Growing up in an ethnic Indian household and as the child of two immigrants, there was always this fear engraved into my parents' minds that I would become ungrounded, forget my roots, and become another product of western society. My father, in particular, combated this by bringing me to any places that even remotely resembled our Punjabi culture. Although I don't recall exactly when I was brought to the Punjabi Grocery & Deli, I do remember the confusion and endless questions I imposed on my father as to why I was expected to learn about my culture from a run-down shop. However, all my doubts would soon go away when I saw my father’s expression light up as he stepped foot into the deli and greeted the owner. The familiarity and relief he felt with every word of his mother tongue, no longer restricted to corporate English, all made sense. It’s easy to understand how something can stick around for almost thirty years in a city where even a year feels like a lifetime when it comes to the Punjabi Grocery & Deli.

            <p>While others chose to sneer at the condition of the store, my father and thousands of other immigrants embraced it and allowed it to become their safe haven. The interior bears the sign of customers past and not marks of deterioration. It's a historical exhibit on its own because it holds more stories and culture than any other gentrified place in Manhattan. There's more to this “cheap-eats” spot, but not if you judge it merely based on its appearance.
